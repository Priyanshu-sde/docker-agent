in a tmux session on an isolated git worktree, and moving a card forward
through the pipeline (Dev → Review → Push → Done) sends the
destination column's prompt to its agent.

Projects and column prompts are stored in the global config file
(~/.config/cagent/config.yaml) and can be managed from the TUI.`,
